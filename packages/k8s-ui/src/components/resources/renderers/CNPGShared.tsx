 * needs a timestamp — and "Last Successful Backup 1d ago" next to "Last Failed
 * Attempt 1d ago" is the same string for events a week apart in the failure
 * history, which is precisely when you are reading this screen. Same treatment
 * the certificate rows already use.
 *
 * Shared by the Cluster and ObjectStore pages: the same recovery point is
 * reachable from both depending on whether backups run through the plugin, and
 * the two must not describe it differently.
