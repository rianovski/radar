# Bootstrap a kind cluster pre-populated with Velero backup/restore scenarios
# for visual-testing the Velero views and the backup-failure Issues.
# Idempotent — re-run to refresh state or apply fixture updates without
# recreating the cluster.
#
# READ THIS FIRST — why `up` scales the Velero controller to zero.
#
#   A live controller with no bucket produces exactly one outcome — everything
#   Failed with a credentials error — which is the least interesting row in the
#   table. Freezing it lets the fixtures carry their own status, so all thirteen
#   phases are on screen at once, including the in-flight ones that by
#   definition do not sit still on a working cluster.
#
#   The `live` subcommand is the other half: it installs MinIO, lets Velero run,
#   and earns the states instead — Completed, a real restore, PartiallyFailed
#   from a failing hook, FailedValidation from a broken location, and a run left
#   genuinely stalled. Everything below describes `up`.
#
#   So the controller is installed and then scaled to 0, and the fixtures carry
#   their own status. Nothing reconciles it away, and every phase in the enum
#   becomes reachable. This is the whole trick; without it you will spend an
#   hour wondering why your hand-written status keeps reverting.
#
#   Worth knowing, because the usual advice sends you the wrong way: none of
#   the Velero CRDs declare a status subresource, so a plain `kubectl apply`
#   writes status. `kubectl patch --subresource=status` fails against them with
#   a confusing NotFound.
#
#   The cost, in `up` only: nothing exercises real controller behaviour. Use
#   `live` when that is the point. Out of reach in both: data-mover
#   DataUpload/DataDownload CRs, progress counters ticking while a run is in
#   flight, and full backup logs. See the README's "What `up` cannot cover".
#
# Subcommands:
#   up        Create cluster (if missing), install Velero CRDs, apply fixtures.
#   down      Delete the kind cluster.
#   reset     down + up.
#   status    Inventory what's installed and what the fixtures look like.
#   live      Give Velero real object storage (MinIO) and let the controller
#             produce the states itself: a real backup, a real restore, a
#             PartiallyFailed run, a location that genuinely breaks, a rejected
#             backup, and a run that genuinely stalls. Slower than `up`, and the
#             honest way to check this integration.
#   verify    Re-run the fixture assertions without reapplying.

#   - python3  (expands the @now tokens; in `live`, also reads the results
